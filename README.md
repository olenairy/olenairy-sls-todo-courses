## Description
For my Capstone Project I chose Serverless technology becouse that enable me to build more agile applications, for example AWS Lambda come with automatic scaling, built-in high availability.

My Pretty ToDos App based on code from course 4 project and have more functionality features. Frontend of the project was largely changed both visually and functionally. Added feature to edit text and Due Date, not only change the image. Added reforvarding to home page after edit text or upload image.

Step 4: Test your application
Write unit tests and perform integration tests or user based testing.

## Functionality

Pretty ToDos App keep the ToDo list and shows them beautifully. Allows users to update images, edit text and due date.
User of the web application can use the interface to create, delete and complete ToDos. The application allows users to upload a file. User of the web interface can click on a "image" button, then select and upload a file. After that the file is being process to convert to thumbnails picture. File appear in the Todo properties on the home page. User of the web interface can click on a "pencil" button, then edit Todo and Due Date.
The application only displays list of ToDo for a logged in user. Authentication is implemented and does not allow unauthenticated access.

## How to run the application

```
